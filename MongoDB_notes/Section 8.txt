Section 8:

Aggregation:
-------------

Stages & Operators:

1. There are plenty of available stages and operators you can choose from
2. Stages define the different steps your data is funneled through
3. Each stage receives the output of the last stage as input
4. Operators can be used inside of stages to transform, limit or re-calculate data

Important Stages:

1. The most important stages are $match, $group, $project, $sort and $unwind - you'll work with these a lot.
2. Whilst there are some common behaviors between find() filters + projection and $match + $project, the aggregation stages generally are more flexible.

sol:

db.persons.aggragate([
	{ $match: { 'dob.age': { $gt: 50 } } },
	{ &group: {
	      _id: { gender: '$gender' },
	      numPersons: { $sum: 1 },
	      avgAge: { $avg: '$dob.age' }
	   }
	},
	{ $sort: { numPersons: -1 } }
]).pretty();
